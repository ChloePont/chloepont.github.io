# What happened in the music charts in 2000?

At the beginning of this century, music tastes were quite similar to what they are now. Based on the billboard top 100 chart of year 2000 we will see that most of the artists who reached number 1 in the top are very much still present in the charts today.
We will also see some interesting results on the ranking evolution of the charts that reached number one during year 2000.

As you can see, the genre that was most represented in the 2000 charts was Rock. Over 40% of the songs that were in the top 100 in 2000 were Rock songs.
Along with Country and Latin, it was the only genre that had songs reach number 1 in the top. Out of the 17 songs that reached number 1 in 2000, 15 were Rock songs.

It is interesting to see that the songs that stayed in the top the longest do not necessarily reach the top position. And similarly songs that reached the top position do not necessarily remain in the top for very long.
